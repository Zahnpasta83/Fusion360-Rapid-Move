This application is a GCode Rapid Move Converter designed to optimize CNC machining processes by automatically replacing linear feed moves (G1/G01) with rapid moves (G0/G00) when the tool height exceeds a specified threshold.

## How It Works:

User Interface (GUI)
The app provides an easy-to-use Tkinter-based GUI.

Users can select an input GCode file (.nc or .gcode).

Users can choose an output folder where the modified file will be saved.

A threshold height (in millimeters) can be set via an input field (default: 4 mm).

Clicking the "Convert" button processes the file.
Conversion Process

The app reads the input GCode file line by line.
It ignores comments and empty lines.

It extracts Z-values from movement commands.

If the tool height (Z-value) is above the specified threshold:
The linear feed move (G1/G01) is replaced with a rapid move (G0/G00).

The modified GCode is then saved as a new file (*_Rapid.nc).

## Additional Features
Customizable threshold: Users can change the height at which rapid moves are applied.
Error handling: The app prevents invalid inputs and displays error messages if necessary.

## Use Case
This application is useful for CNC programmers and machinists who want to optimize their toolpath movements. 
By replacing unnecessary feed moves with rapid moves above a certain height, machining time is reduced, and CNC machine efficiency is improved.

## üìå Why this warning?

Incorrect G-code modifications could lead to unexpected behavior of your CNC machine.
A wrong threshold value or misinterpretation of movements may cause crashes or damage.
Always review the generated code before running it on your machine.

## How to Run the App on a Mac
To run the GCode Rapid Move Converter on a Mac, follow these steps:

## 1. Install Python
The app is written in Python, so you need to have Python installed.

Check if Python is already installed by running:
```
python3 --version
```
If Python is not installed, download and install it from:
https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/

Make sure pip (Python's package manager) is installed as well:
```
python3 -m ensurepip --default-pip
```

## 2. Install Required Dependencies
The app requires tkinter (for the GUI) and re (for text processing). tkinter is usually pre-installed with Python, but if it's missing, install it with:
```
brew install python-tk
```
Then, install any additional dependencies from requirements.txt (if provided):
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
## 3. Run the APP
Navigate to the folder where the script is located and execute the APP
